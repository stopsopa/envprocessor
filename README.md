# The problem

Sometimes we would like to make some env vars available in the browser - on the client side. 

Obviously we have to be very careful with that, because we don't want to expose any sensitive information.

Anyway, it is often beneficial to just somehow expose some env vars to the browser, so we can use them in our browser code.

After working for few years with different frameworks I've noticed that most of the frameworks have builtin support for that:
- Create React App (tool deprecated now) [link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
- Vite [link](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#:~:text=only%20variables%20prefixed%20with%20VITE_%20are%20exposed)
- Next.js [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser)

The problem with all solutions above is that each of them allows you to expose only during build time.
So it means you can't expose anything specific to PROD, STAGING or DEV environment because during build these environments are not available/visible yet.

Once build is done exposed variables becomes part of the build itself - so in other words they are hardcoded in the bundle.

Another problem is that each of framwork allows to expose only env vars prefixed with some specific prefix (e.g. VITE_ or REACT_APP_).
It would be nice to have more flexibility here and be able to pick exactly what we want to expose.

So let's try to find a solution to that.

# The solution

Solution is based on the fact that for each of these framework we can modify the main HTML file and inject our custom (generated) script exposing env vars to the browser like:

```js

// dist/preprocessed.js file

window.process = {
  env: {
    "MY_ENV": "value",
    "ANOTHER_ENV_VAR": "1.99.2"
  }
};

```

This script have to be loaded before our bundled code assembled by given framework during build time, so like (just example):

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My app...</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <script src="/dist/preprocessed.js"></script> 
        <!-- just make sure to load that before bundled code -->

    <script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script> 
        <!-- generated by our framework Vite or Next.js-->
    
  </body>
</html>

```


Then in our code we can use library 'envprocessor' which will pick up `window.process.env` and provide set of method to work with env vars in the browser:

```js

import { getThrow, has } from "envprocessor";

if (has('MY_ENV')) {
  console.log(getThrow('MY_ENV'));
} else {
  console.log('MY_ENV not found');
}

```

Important thing to understand is that natural point where building/generating `/dist/preprocessed.js` have to happen is just before launching the app in the final environment (e.g. in the pod).

Normally our pod will be defined with entrypoint in Dockerfile something like:

```
FROM node:...

... other stuff in Dockefile

ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "start"]
```

In order to generate `/dist/preprocessed.js` we would need to install `npm install envprocessor` (not as a devDependencies) and can create shell script in our project like:

```bash
# start.sh file

set -e # this is actually important to forward errors
set -x # we can also add debug mode (optional) - that will print every command before executing in the pod log

node node_modules/.bin/envprocessor --mask "^TERM_" dist/preprocessed.js
# add --debug and --verbose flags to command above if you need more details

# then we can just run our app as before
npm run start

```

Then we can swap our entrypoint in Dockerfile to:

```
ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "start.sh"]
```




# Install

```bash

npm install envprocessor

yarn add envprocessor

```

# Try from CLI

```bash

# to see help and version
npx envprocessor

npx envprocessor --mask "^(TERM_|USER|HOME)" --verbose --debug --enrichModule node_modules/envprocessor/enrich.js var/preprocessed.js var/dist/prep.js
# mask above is just an example, probably you will not want to expose USER env var ...
# thiat will generate two files: var/preprocessed.js var/dist/prep.js
# and will add some extra env vars by executing custom script
# in this case it is node_modules/envprocessor/enrich.js but you can use this one as an example
# and create your own

# I would create these "added" env vars "synthetic env vars". 
# Because it can be anything you like but those
# will not exist in original backend environment as real pod env vars

# the same way as you don't expose all env vars from the backend, here you will have env vars which will only
# exist in the browser

# you might also provide mask using env var injected into the pod during creation if you wish,
# this way we have to just tell the tool which env var to use to get the mask like:

export MASK="^(TERM_|USER|HOME)"
npx envprocessor --maskEnv "MASK" --verbose --debug var/preprocessed.js

# once you install envprocessor:
npm install envprocessor

# you can use it directly from node_modules

node node_modules/.bin/envprocessor

# CJS
node node_modules/envprocessor/dist/cjs/cli.cjs

# ESM
node node_modules/envprocessor/dist/esm/cli.js

# or register in package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preprocessor": "envprocessor --mask '^(TERM_|USER|HOME)' --verbose --debug --enrichModule node_modules/envprocessor/enrich.js var/preprocessed.js var/dist/prep.js"
  }
}

# and then run it (also you can use this style in start.sh above):
npm run preprocessor`

```

# Examples from js module

There is also way to create custom script where you can extend behaviour of envprocessor the way you like:

- [examples](examples) directory
- web example [/envprocessor/examples/index.html](https://stopsopa.github.io/envprocessor/examples/index.html) loading preprocessed.js into the browser context - just inspect it with chrome developer tools

# Using from the project

add loading script below before scripts loading transpiled js in your project main html:

```html

<script src="/envprocessed.js"></script>

```

then use env vars in browser using:

```js

// ESM
import {   
  get,
  has,
  getDefault,
  getThrow,

  getIntegerThrowInvalid, // equivalent to get
  getIntegerDefault,
  getIntegerThrow, 
} from "envprocessor";

// CJS
const {   
  get,
  has,
  getDefault,
  getThrow,

  getIntegerThrowInvalid, // equivalent to get
  getIntegerDefault,
  getIntegerThrow,  
} = require("envprocessor");

console.log(`get('USER') >${get("USER")}`);

```
